What is abICS ?
------------------------------------------
abICS is a software framework for performing configurational sampling in disordered systems,
with a specific emphasis on multi-component solid state systems such as metal and oxide alloys.
The current version of abics allows aenet to be used as a neural network.
First-principles calculation solvers (Quantum Espresso, VASP, OpenMX) are used to create training data for the neural network.
