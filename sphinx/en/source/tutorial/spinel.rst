Calculation of the degree of inversion of Mg, Al atoms in an ionic crystal MgAl2O4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Input files are available from ``examples/standard/spinel`` .

Example by using QuantumESPRESSO
=======================================

Preparing the input files for abICS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The input file of abICS is ``input_qe.toml`` .

::

   [replica]
   nreplicas = 2
   nprocs_per_replica = 1

   kTstart = 1000.0
   kTend = 1200.0

   nsteps = 5  # Number of steps for sampling
   RXtrial_frequency = 1
   sample_frequency = 1
   print_frequency = 1

``[replica]`` is a section for specifying parameters of the exchange Monte Carlo method.
In this example, the number of the replicas is 2 and the number of the steps is 5.

::

   [solver]
   type = 'qe'
   path= './pw.x'
   base_input_dir = './baseinput'
   perturb = 0.0
   run_scheme = 'mpi_spawn'


``[solver]`` is a section for specifying a solver program.
This examples set ``type`` as ``qe`` in order to use Quantum ESPRESSO (QE).
``path`` specifies the path to ``pw.x``, the SCF energy solver of QE.
The directory that contains the input parameter files specific to each solver is given as ``./baseinput`` using ``base_input_dir``.
``perturb`` is a random parameter that shifts atomic positions for structural optimization, but in this example it is set to 0 not to perform structural optimization.
abICS starts ``pw.x`` with ``MPI_Comm_spawn``, so give ``mpi_spawn`` as ``run_scheme``.

::

   [config]
   unitcell = [[8.1135997772, 0.0000000000, 0.0000000000],
               [0.0000000000, 8.1135997772, 0.0000000000],
               [0.0000000000, 0.0000000000, 8.1135997772]]
   supercell = [1,1,1]


``[config]`` is the atomic position section.
Specify the simulation cell (In units of angstrom) to be simulated by ``unitcell`` and ``supercell``.

``[[config.base_structure]]`` is a section that specifies the atoms that should not be moved in the Monte Carlo calculation.
``type`` is the name of the atom and ``coords`` is the fraction coordinate where the atom is located.
``coords`` can be used to give not only a list of lists but also a string representing a numeric matrix with three columns separated by white space and as many rows as there are atoms.

``[[config.defect_structure]]`` is the section for specifying the positions of the atoms you want to move in the Monte Carlo calculation.

``[[config.defect_structure.groups]]`` is the section for specifying the name and number of atoms to be moved in the Monte Carlo calculation.
Scatter the 16 ``Al`` and 8 ``Mg`` atoms into the coordinates specified by ``[[config.defect_structure]]``.


Preparing the input file of QE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

abICS generates the input files of the solver from the internal atomic structure, but information other than the structure, such as pseudopotential information, must be supplied by the user.
In the case of QE, such information is specified by ``scf.in`` in the directory specified by ``base_input_dir`` in the format of the input file of ``pw.x``. 
Based on this file, an input file with unit cells and atomic structure is automatically generated.

- Notes
  - The pseudopotential directory ``pseudo_dir`` must be passed as an absolute path. ``~`` expands to the user's home directory.
  - ``disk_io`` must not be ``none`` .


Execution and analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See "How to use" section for information on setting the number of processes and options for running MPI.

::

   mpiexec -np 2 abics input_qe.toml


After the abICS calculation, the degree of inversion (DOI: ratio of Al atoms where Mg atoms were originally located) is calculated.
To do this, use the scripts ``separateT.py`` and ``calc_DOI.py`` in the ``examples/standard/spinel`` directory.

First, use ``separateT.py`` to summarize the structure information for each replica by temperature::

  mpiexec -np 2 python3 ./separateT.py input_qe.toml

The results are stored in the ``Tseparate`` directory.
If this directory already exists, the old one is moved to another directory ``Tseparate.DATE`` (``DATE`` is the current datetime).

Next, calculate DOI by using ``calc_DOI.py``::

  mpiexec -np 2 python3 ./calc_DOI.py input_qe.toml

The results are stored in ``Tseparate/DOI_T.dat`` .

.. image:: ../../../image/doi_2.*
   :width: 400px
   :align: center


If you increase the number of replicas, you can calculate at various temperatures.
You can also get better results by increasing the number of steps.
The first number of samples to discard in Monte Carlo averaging can be specified by the value of ``throwout`` in the ``calc_DOI.py`` script.
For example, if you do with 17 replicas and 20 steps, the following result will be obtained

.. image:: ../../../image/doi_17.*
   :width: 400px
   :align: center

You can see that DOI increases as the temperature increases.
