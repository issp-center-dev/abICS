What is abICS ?
------------------------------------------
abICS is a software framework for performing configurational sampling in disordered systems, with a specific emphasis on multi-component solid state systems such as metal and oxide alloys. It couples parallel sampling methods with external codes that perform structural relaxation and energy calculations. We provide interfaces for Quantum Espresso, VASP, and aenet, with planned support for OpenMX in the near future.
